# Static Kit

Static Kit is a simple, standardized toolkit to aid in the creation and compilation of various static assets (Javascript, CSS, or images) for traditional frontends of all kinds.

## Installation

**Download the library**

Currently, the best way to install Static Kit is to download directly from Github.
https://github.com/wndrfl/static-kit

From there, you should put the contents of Static Kit in the appropriate directory of your project.

**Install the dependencies**

Navigate to Static Kit directory and run `npm install`.

**Configure Static Kit (optional)**

By default, Static Kit has reasonable defaults. There are directories that come with the library to house your source Javascript files, SCSS files, and images. In addition, Static Kit will compile all assets to directories inside the Static Kit root directory, as well.

That said, it is possible to easily configure the paths for both the source and destination directories by editing the `statickit.json` file in the root of the Static Kit library. This is helpful, for instance, if your project requires these files to live outside of Static Kit.
